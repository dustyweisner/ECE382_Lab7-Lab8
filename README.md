Robot Sensing and Robot Maze


__*Lab 7 "Robot Sensing"*__


Required Functionality  
Use the ADC subsystem to light LEDs based on the presence of a wall. The presence of a wall next to the left sensor should light LED1 on your Launchpad board. The presence of a wall next to the right sensor should light LED2 on your Launchpad board. Demonstrate that the LEDs do not light until they come into close proximity with a wall.

B Functionality  
Create a standalone library for your ATD code and release it on Github. This should be separate from your lab code. It should have a thoughtful interface and README, capable of being reused in the robot maze laboratory.

A Functionality  
Since each robot's sensors are a little bit different, you need to fully characterize the sensor for your robot. Create a table and graphical plot that shows the ATD values for a variety of distances from a maze wall. This table/graph must be generated for each IR sensor. Use these values to determine how the IR sensors work so you can properly use them to solve the maze.


__Prelab__  
To begin the lab I decided to include information from this lab I thought will be useful in creating my program.
